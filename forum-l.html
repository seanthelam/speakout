                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think of when you hear the term “racial inequality?”</b> <br>
                            “Yeah racism or the systems in place that hold people of color back from receiving equal opportunities or 
                            success, like financial success, especially compared to white people.” </p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>Can you think of specific examples of racial inequality in the educational setting?</b><br>
                            “School districts with majority POC students don’t get the same amount of resources and educational opportunities 
                            compared to white people or in the higher education of HBCUs, they are not seen as equally prestigious and they also 
                            just don’t have the same amount of resources that rich white colleges have.”
                            <br><b>Would you consider the fact that 68% of CC’s population is white is an example of racial inequality?</b>
                            <br>“Obviously we had some prior experience with CC beforehand, so I wasn’t really surprised, but coming here I feel 
                            like I never thought about my economic class, so seeing people who were really wealthy was a big culture shock for me. 
                            But the white part wasn’t as surprising for me.” 
                        </p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What, if any, are your experiences with racism/racial inequality in education?</b> <br>
                            “I went to a white Catholic school my whole life, so I experienced a lot of different forms of racism, starting with 
                            exclusion. I felt like I had to prove my intelligence a lot, people just assumed that I was dumb, which is one thing 
                            I’m very confident about now. I felt like I had a lot of internalized racism when I was younger, and middle school was 
                            when I really started to break out of that. People would pull the braids out of my hair and whip me with them, hide my 
                            braids around the school and then get mad at me because they were gross, a girl would spit on me. High school is when I 
                            really tried to counteract that, so I did a project that was about trying to better the experiences of children of color 
                            within the local Catholic school district, so I did a presentation to the superintendent and all the principals. I did a 
                            speech for CC’s All People’s breakfast about Martin Luther King, where the prompt was “It starts with us,” so I talked about 
                            how I tried to counteract racial inequality. The major catalyst was that I felt like I was trying to do stuff within the 
                            Catholic school system and obviously they’re not gonna acknowledge it from within, so I started going outside the Catholic 
                            school system and I had two articles written about my experience within Catholic school and that made a lot of people at my 
                            school mad. Students at my school made an anonymous submission to Instagram that was mostly talking shit about me, calling 
                            me the n-word. My article was shared with the parent Facebook group and a lot of parents were justifying my experience, 
                            saying it wasn’t their kids fault, when it definitely is. I had a parent come to school and yell at me, even my teachers 
                            were trying to minimize my experience. But I definitely think that scared my school, they did some reactive stuff, but now 
                            that I’m gone I don't think anything has really changed.”

                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think one can do to address racial inequality on an individual level?</b><br>
                            “I think to be aware of what has been historically and systemically oppressing people and preventing them from 
                            achieving equality and to undertake efforts to combat people engaging in that (racist) behavior because what can 
                            happen is someone might have some generational thing that they’ve been taught that leads them to more racist beliefs. 
                            You want people to be aware that that’s like, not okay, and obviously there are bigger issues that need to be solved 
                            with bigger solutions, but I think it is correct to see we need to help combat people’s individual biases, and there 
                            are disagreements over how to do that, but I think it’s important that we do that.”</p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think CC could do better to address racial inequality in general?</b><br>
                            “I think they’re doing a lot to address it. I think just making clear that acting in a racist way towards someone is 
                            unacceptable and that it has no place here and that any kind of discrimination is not alright. And, they’ve already 
                            done this but improvements can be made because it’s a really touchy subject and there is a lot of painful history behind 
                            it, but I think just continuing to put an effort to make people aware of the discrimination that has existed and trying 
                            to combat it. They have many resources like the Butler Center and those kinds of things to help people who are historically 
                            disadvantaged or treated as lesser than.”</p>
