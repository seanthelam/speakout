                        <p style="background-color:red; padding:10px;">In 2023, Colorado College students Owen Blazick, 
                            Sean Lam, and Jimmy O'Connell decided to take Racial Inequality - 
                            a class focused on the study of race as a dimension of inequality. They
                            learned about individual and institutional forms of racism and discrimination,
                            looking at historical, comparative, and theoretical perspectives. With this,
                            they sought to better understand and see the impacts of racial inequality
                            outside of the classroom. Owen, Sean, and Jimmy started conducting interviews
                            to see how others viewed and experienced racial inequality. It was clear that
                            this was something crucial to discuss about in the modern day. Thus, <span><b>Speak Out</b></span>
                            was created as a space for other individuals to tell their own stories and read
                            about others. It was also established for others to create proposals and demands,
                            and to address and educate about racial inequality.</p>
                        <p style="background-color:red; padding:10px;">The mission of this website is to provide an anonymous 
                            space for students to not only tell their own experiences with racism and racial inequality in education, 
                            but also for students to educate themselves by reading othersâ€™ stories. We hope that this website 
                            contributes to a growing critical consciousness that addresses racial inequality not only at CC, but the 
                            higher education system at large. </p>
