                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think of when you hear the term “racial inequality?”</b> <br>
                            “I think of inequities that exist between people of different colors of skin, typically the method 
                            by which people would differentiate and discriminate against historically, and it can come in a whole 
                            lot of different forms. It used to be via segregation, but now there are issues like housing segregation 
                            and that kind of thing.”</p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>Can you think of specific examples of racial inequality in the educational setting?</b><br>
                            “Well because of historical segregation that had happened, today in inner city schools, unfortunately there 
                            are a lot of cases where people who are impacted by poor school funding especially in cities like Chicago 
                            and New York and other cities that have predominantly had racial/ethnic minorities, which means societally 
                            it’s harder for them to have better opportunities because their education is of a lower quality.”</p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What, if any, are your experiences with racism/racial inequality in education?</b> <br>
                            “I haven’t really had anything happen that was overtly racist in my experience, the (high) school that 
                            I went to had a history of that (overt racism) happening, but it was way before I went there in 2019. 
                            So not me directly experiencing it but the school that I went to in Virginia has a history of it.”
                            <br><b>Would you consider the fact that 68% of CC’s population is white is an example of racial inequality?</b>
                            <br>“I would say, yeah that could be a sign. I would say it relates more to who can afford to go here would more
                             likely be people from white backgrounds because there is a wealth disparity that exists. So I think, it’s not 
                             the makeup itself (of the college), but the reason why it’s like that, and I think you could say it’s because 
                             of the wealth inequality issue. It costs a lot to go here.”

                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think one can do to address racial inequality on an individual level?</b><br>
                            “I think to be aware of what has been historically and systemically oppressing people and preventing them from 
                            achieving equality and to undertake efforts to combat people engaging in that (racist) behavior because what can 
                            happen is someone might have some generational thing that they’ve been taught that leads them to more racist beliefs. 
                            You want people to be aware that that’s like, not okay, and obviously there are bigger issues that need to be solved 
                            with bigger solutions, but I think it is correct to see we need to help combat people’s individual biases, and there 
                            are disagreements over how to do that, but I think it’s important that we do that.”</p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think CC could do better to address racial inequality in general?</b><br>
                            “I think they’re doing a lot to address it. I think just making clear that acting in a racist way towards someone is 
                            unacceptable and that it has no place here and that any kind of discrimination is not alright. And, they’ve already 
                            done this but improvements can be made because it’s a really touchy subject and there is a lot of painful history behind 
                            it, but I think just continuing to put an effort to make people aware of the discrimination that has existed and trying 
                            to combat it. They have many resources like the Butler Center and those kinds of things to help people who are historically 
                            disadvantaged or treated as lesser than.”</p>
