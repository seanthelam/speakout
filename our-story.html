                        <p>I am a white, cis-man from a small town in Pennsylvania called Mountain Top. I lived in Mountain Top for my entire life; 
                            I was born in a small city not too far away from my house, and the northeast Pennsylvania region is the only place I 
                            have ever called home. My hometown is predominantly white; it includes various suburbs, most of which are home to 
                            middle-class white families. There are some very wealthy neighborhoods, but most of the neighborhoods in my town are more 
                            middle-class.</p>
                        <p>I had very limited exposure to people who did not share the same race as me. For as long as I can remember, my classmates, 
                            teammates, and friends were mostly white. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had the privilege of living a life free of 
                            racial discrimination; no one ever made harsh comments about my race. I was part of the majority. I got to enjoy the luxury 
                            of “fitting in” as a white person in what I would consider to be a white space. As a member of a white upper middle-class 
                            family in a mostly white town, I had many opportunities that others did not. I got to enjoy expensive sports like golf and 
                            skiing. I was a member of a community at a country club that showed me tremendous amounts of support throughout my childhood. 
                            As a child, I never really had to think about my racial identity since I “belonged”.</p>
                        <p>As I progressed through school, I started to recognize racial inequality. I began to notice racist tendencies in and out of my 
                            school environment around the time I entered high school. Some of my classmates would make racist remarks or jokes, and everyone 
                            would laugh at them. These types of comments rarely received any kind of backlash; they were made by white people and received by 
                            white people. Similar situations would happen at the country club. Some members would make racist comments, and no one would bat 
                            an eye; these comments were considered normal in this setting.</p>
                        <p>Looking back at my childhood, I’ve become aware of the fact that I grew up in a very conservative environment. I think this is the 
                            reason I started to notice racism during my high school years. During Donald Trump’s presidency, many residents of my town felt that 
                            their racist beliefs were justified to some extent, so they felt more comfortable expressing their beliefs. I believe the insulated 
                            nature of the white space I lived in promoted the exchange of racist comments, some more explicit than others. As a member of a liberal 
                            household, my father would always complain about the racist nature of our town. My father was one of the main reasons for why I was able 
                            to recognize the presence of racism in my town. He made an effort to educate me about things happening outside the white bubble I lived 
                            in, and I am extremely grateful for this. As a member of a white space, I understand that growing up in a household that is anti-racist is 
                            somewhat of a privilege. I understand that not everyone who comes from a white space is aware of the different aspects of race and racial 
                            inequality, and I hope this website succeeds in providing valuable experiences real people have dealt with involving race.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this project is to provide a space where we can educate each other about race and racial inequality. When I came to Colorado College, 
                            I had little exposure to racial inequality. My experience in block 4 with the class Racial Inequality was very valuable to me, as I learned about 
                            the parts of racism I never experienced before. I understand not all Colorado College students will have the opportunity to take this class, so 
                            hopefully this website can communicate some of the most important parts of this class.</p>

                        <p>I am a white, cis-man born and raised in San Francisco, California. I have attended PWIs throughout my education, never 
                            really reflecting on the white, privileged spaces I grew up in. My middle school, Sts. Peter and Paul, high school, 
                            Lick-Wilmerding, and now college, Colorado College, are all majority white. My middle school used to celebrate the 
                            “Columbus Day Bazaar” every year, a big festival that the local community took part in. They have since changed it to 
                            “Indigenous People’s Day.” My high school was a little better, holding events like “Carnival” to celebrate Hispanic culture, 
                            but it was still 62% white. Taking the course “Racial Inequality” at Colorado College, taught by Professor Inara Rodis, has 
                            expanded my awareness of the systemic and institutionalized racism that is everywhere in education. Topics about race and 
                            racial inequality were rarely discussed in these educational settings, and even within my own family, and I’m willing to bet 
                            that a lot of people have the same experience here at CC. So we thought it was a good idea to create a space where students 
                            can learn from each others’ experiences regarding racism and racial inequality and start educating themselves about racial 
                            inequality in education.</p>
