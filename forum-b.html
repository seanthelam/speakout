                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think of when you hear the term “racial inequality?”</b> <br>
                            “The first thing that comes to my head is racism.” </p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>Can you think of specific examples of racial inequality in the educational setting?</b><br>
                            “My view is the lack of black teachers and black professors is a really big aspect of the educational system 
                            where there is a lot of racial inequality.”</br>
                            <b>Would you consider the fact that 68% of CC’s population is white is an example of racial inequality?</b>
                            <br>“It really enunciates it, the dynamics of CC money-wise, like how everyone here skis or everyone here went to a 
                            boarding school. It enunciates how big white spaces are and how for people of color we can’t really connect with white 
                            people because we don’t ski, we didn’t go to a boarding school, stuff like that.”
                        </p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What, if any, are your experiences with racism/racial inequality in education?</b> <br>
                            “Me and A both have the experience of being the only Black girls in our school which speaks to our educational experience. 
                            For A, she was at a PWI for most of her life, but I was able to get out. Her experience was more rough than mine, I stopped 
                            at 7th grade when I was first experiencing racism but I didn’t experience it in high school like she did. I think the main 
                            thing is feeling so alone and excluded in your school, which is supposed to be a safe place because that’s where you learn.” 
                        </p><br>
                        <p style="color:black;"><b>What do you think one can do to address racial inequality on an individual level?</b><br>
                            *This is mostly about the social part of racism/racial inequality*<br>
                            “I also wanna add like, especially on the exclusion part for people of color women get it worse than men like feeling excluded 
                            from all environments. Not only PWI, but also HBCU. I know my sister has been through her own IRO going to an HBCU. Like it’s nice 
                            to be around your people but you also never really feel included within your people because there are so many different aspects of 
                            being Black so they like isolate you. You get discriminated against for what you eat, what you look like, what you listen to, so 
                            it’s basically not feeling included in any environment you’re in I feel like is the hardest part of the educational system. It is 
                            hard for all people of color of course, but men have it so much easier especially in PWI settings. I feel like they get accepted 
                            because they are men, but if we’re going off the sexism chart why do white women also get accepted? But then it’s also because of 
                            race so it's really hard when you’re both a woman and Black because there really is no line for us.”
